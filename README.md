# Hack_web_admin

python admin_panel_sniffer.py --domain [target domain] --progress [index of the page the script reached last run] --page_extension [website language] --strict [True or False] --save [Save the results to a text file?] --verbose [print links as they're tested?] --wordlist [dictionary file to use] --robots [if True don't enter anything else except the domain name]

    domain is obvious.
    progress: the index of the page the script reached last run.. The script displays and saves this value in the results file after every run. 0 starts from the beginning.
    page_extension: whether the website uses html asp php... default value is a which checks everything...
    strict: whether or not you care about 403 and 401 responses.
    verbose: whether or not you want the script to show each link as it's being tested

or:

    python admin_panel_sniffer.py --domain [target domain] --robots True to search in the robots.txt file that usually contains the admin panel

python admin_panel_sniffer.py h or help for more details.. or of course take a look at the source code ;)
